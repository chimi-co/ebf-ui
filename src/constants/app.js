      contributions to six positive impacts (air, water, soil,
      biodiversity, equity, and carbon).
      These impacts can be expressed through a mix of
      qualitative and quantitative approaches to measurement.
      In this section, we give project owners the opportunity to
      describe their sense of the qualitative impacts of their
      project.
      Ensure that the project understand we are talking about a
      specific project and not their company - meaning, we need
      to think about a specific case, and not the process of
      project development for example.
      What is the specific issue or challenge that this project has
      addressed? Defining the "what" involves clearly articulating
      the problem statement, its scope, and its underlying causes.
      It requires gathering information, conducting research, and
      analyzing the root causes and contributing factors that give
      rise to the problem. The "what" provides a clear
      understanding of the problem's nature and helps guide the
      problem-solving process.`,

      the problem this project is hoping to solve?
      This can include the stakeholders with a vested interest in
      solving the problem, those who have the capacity to
      contribute to its solution, and those who benefit from the
      problem being solved.
      Identifying the "who" involves considering various
      perspectives, such as individuals, communities,
      organizations, policymakers, experts, or other relevant
      parties.
      Understanding the diverse range of stakeholders helps
      determine who should be involved in problem-solving
      efforts.`,
